The version **${version}** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you donâ€™t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of ${monorepoGroupName || dependency}.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you donâ€™t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.
