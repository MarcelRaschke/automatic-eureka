  md`ðŸš¨ You need to enable Continuous Integration on Greenkeeper branches of this repository. ðŸš¨

To enable Greenkeeper, you need to make sure that a [commit status](https://help.github.com/articles/about-statuses/) is reported on all branches. This is required by Greenkeeper because it uses your CI build statuses to figure out when to notify you about breaking changes.

Since we didnâ€™t receive a CI status on the ${branchLink(fullName)} branch, itâ€™s possible that you donâ€™t have CI set up yet. We recommend using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), but Greenkeeper will work with every other CI service as well.

If you _have_ already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check how itâ€™s configured. Make sure it is set to run on all new branches. If you donâ€™t want it to run on absolutely every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with ${md.code('greenkeeper/')}.

Once you have installed and configured CI on this repository correctly, youâ€™ll need to re-trigger Greenkeeperâ€™s initial pull request. To do this, please click the 'fix repo' button on [account.greenkeeper.io](https://account.greenkeeper.io).
