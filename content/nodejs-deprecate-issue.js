## Version ${nodeVersion} of Node.js (code name ${codeName}) has been deprecated! ðŸš‘

It is no longer maintained and will not receive any more security updates. Version ${newLowestVersion} (${newLowestCodeName}) is now the lowest actively maintained Node.js version.
To see what effect this update would have on your code, Greenkeeper has already created a branch with the following changes:
${showTravisMessage(travisModified)}${showNVMRCMessage(nvmrcModified)}${showEngineTransformMessages(engineTransformMessages)}
If youâ€™re interested in removing support for Node.js ${nodeVersion} from this repo, you can <a href="${compareURL}">open a PR with these changes</a>.
${showBlogpost(announcementURL)}
