${dependency} is a direct dependency of this project, and **it is very likely causing it to break**. If other packages depend on yours, this update is probably also breaking those in turn.
`

const devDependency = ({dependency, dependencyType}) => md`
${dependency} is a ${dependencyType.replace(/ies$/, 'y')} of this project. It **might not break your production code or affect downstream projects**, but probably breaks your build or test tools, which may **prevent deploying or publishing**.
